# Implementation Plan - Subscription & Feature Access Platform

## Goal Description
Build a full-stack web application with React, Node.js, and MongoDB that manages user subscriptions and feature access. The system supports Admin, Premium, and Free users.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Security is intentionally basic as per requirements. No real payment gateway will be implemented. Password security and MFA will be placeholders.

## Proposed Changes

### Backend (Node.js + Express)
Structure:
- `server.js`: Entry point
- `config/db.js`: MongoDB connection
- `models/`: Mongoose schemas (User, SubscriptionPlan, Feature)
- `routes/`: API routes (auth, subscriptions, admin)
- `controllers/`: Logic for routes
- `middleware/`: Auth middleware (JWT verification)

#### [NEW] [backend structure]
- `server.js`
- `models/User.js`
- `models/SubscriptionPlan.js`
- `models/Feature.js`
- `routes/authRoutes.js`
- `routes/subscriptionRoutes.js`
- `routes/adminRoutes.js`

### Frontend (React)
Structure:
- `App.js`: Main routing
- `context/AuthContext.js`: Global auth state
- `pages/`: Login, Register, Dashboard, Subscription, PremiumContent, AdminDashboard
- `components/`: Navbar, ProtectedRoute

#### [NEW] [frontend structure]
- `src/App.jsx`
- `src/pages/Login.jsx`
- `src/pages/Register.jsx`
- `src/pages/UserDashboard.jsx`
- `src/pages/SubscriptionPage.jsx`
- `src/pages/PremiumContent.jsx`
- `src/pages/AdminDashboard.jsx`

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- None planned as per "Keep logic simple" and "Basic UI + API only". Manual verification will be primary.

### Manual Verification
1.  **Auth**: Register a new user, Login, Check JWT token in storage, Logout.
2.  **Roles**: Login as Free user, try to access Premium content (should fail/redirect). Login as Premium, access Premium content. Login as Admin, view dashboard.
3.  **Subscription**: Click "Subscribe" on Premium plan, verify user status updates (mocked).
